**StaySmart: Online Dormitory Reservation Platform**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;StaySmart is a Python-based dormitory reservation and management system designed to modernize and simplify the accommodation process for students and administrators. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and supported by a local SQLite database, the system provides an efficient alternative to traditional manual booking methods, which are often slow, prone to error, and difficult to maintain. Research highlights that manual systems frequently result in inaccurate record-keeping, duplication of data, and slow processes (Azal Publishing, 2024; Cesar et al., 2022). In contrast, digital dormitory systems offer improved convenience, transparency, and time-saving benefits, as supported by studies from Alfa University Cyprus (2023) and the University of Bridgeport (2024). StaySmart addresses these challenges by offering a centralized platform for managing dormitories, rooms, student records, user accounts, payments, and financial reports—ensuring a more organized, accurate, and accessible experience for both users and administrators.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The platform allows students to conveniently browse available dorm rooms, review amenities, and reserve accommodations online. Administrators benefit from an intuitive management interface that streamlines tasks such as updating room availability, monitoring occupancy, verifying payments, and generating monthly reports. This approach aligns with findings from the Caraga State University Journal of Public Administration Studies (2023), which highlights how automation reduces delays and miscommunication, and Projectshelve (2023), which emphasizes that online systems significantly cut waiting time compared to paper-based processes. By integrating core concepts from OOP, database management, and general programming, StaySmart demonstrates a practical and structured solution to real-world dormitory management challenges.
